# Chronicler

Chronicler is an interactive D&D tool meant to replace the character sheet used 
when playing D&D and help with various game mechanics.

The project is a work-in-progress, major features include:
- Character-sheet fully equipped with combat stats, spell mechanics and an inventory with feats and skills to come.
- Automatic level-up option in any class you choose as well as a rest option.
- Campaign manager available for the user to create his own campaigns and add one or more characters to.
- Secure account management.

To be added: Feats, skills, better integration for campaigns to be used with other players, better css.

This project uses SQLite and does not require any database preconfigurations for use. 
For testing purposes, use username 'user' and password 'user' to test preconfigured characters and campaigns.

This project uses Java Spring and is built using gradle. 

Run build.gradle and then Application.java to run the Spring server.
